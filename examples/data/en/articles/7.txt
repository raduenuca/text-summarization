"The main purpose of BSRE was to assess the readiness of the participating undertakings to meet the requirements of the Solvency II regime, which shall enter into force on 1 January 2016. The purpose of BSRE was also to comprehensively assess the financial soundness and solvency of the participating undertakings under Solvency I regime, through the analyses made for the reference date 31 December 2014", ASF said in a statement.Reviews were made by seven independent auditors, selected by each undertaking included in the program.The 21 undertakings which participated in this exercise were: ABC Asigurari, ASITO KAPITAL, ASIMED, ATE Insurance Romania, BCR Asigurari de Viata, BRD Asigurari de Viata, CertAsig, CITY Insurance, CREDIT EUROPE, ERGO Asigurari de Viata, EUROLIFE ERB Asigurari Generale, EUROLIFE ERB Asigurari de Viata, FATA Asigurari, FORTE Asigurari, GARANTA, GOTHAER Asigurari - Reasigurari, GRAWE Romania, LIG Insurance, ONIX Asigurari SIGNAL Iduna, UNIQA Asigurari de Viata.Based on the BSRE results and having regard to the requirements of Solvency I regime, the participating insurance undertakings were classified in the following groups:: insurance undertakings with negative equity - LIG;: insurance undertakings which do not have an available solvency margin larger than the guarantee fund - Forte, ABC, Asito Kapital, CertAsig;: insurance undertakings which do not have an available solvency margin larger than the minimum solvency margin - no such cases identified;: insurance undertakings which do not have assets admitted to cover the gross technical provisions larger than gross technical provisions - Forte, LIG, CertAsig;: insurance undertakings which meet the solvency requirements (e.g., available solvency margin larger than minimum solvency margin and guarantee fund) - 16 undertakings, i.e. Asimed, BRD Viata, Gothaer, Grawe, Uniqa Viata, BCR Viata, Onix, ATE, Garanta, ERB Generale, ERB Viata, Ergo, Signal Iduna, Fata, Credit Europe and City. However, City does not meet the minimum liquidity requirements.Thus, out of the total number of 21 insurance undertakings participating in the BSRE test, five undertakings (Forte, ABC, Asito Kapital, CertAsig and LIG), covering risks only of the non-life insurance category, do not meet, after the adjustments made by auditors, the legal requirements on solvency, of which 3 (Forte, CertAsig and LIG) do not meet the requirements on coverage of technical provisions with admitted assets either.Based on the BSRE results and having regard to the requirements of Solvency II regime, the participating insurance undertakings were classified in the following groups:: insurance undertakings with negative own funds - LIG.: insurance undertakings which, based on the BSRE results and without prejudice to any of the subsequent adjustment measures taken after the test, do not meet the minimum capital requirement (MCR) ‐ Signal Iduna, Forte, Gothaer, Fata, ABC, ATE and Asito Kapital.: insurance undertakings which, based on the BSRE results and without prejudice to any of the subsequent adjustment measures taken after the test, do not meet the minimum solvency requirement (SCR) ‐ Signal Iduna, Forte, Gothaer, Certasig, Credit Europe and City.: insurance undertakings which, based on the BSRE results, meet MCR and SCR - Onix, Brd Viata, Asimed, ERB Generale, ERB Viata, Uniqa Viata, Grawe, Garanta, BCR Viata and Ergo.Thus, out of the total number of 21 participating insurance undertakings, 4 undertakings do not meet the minimum capital requirement (MCR), but cover the solvency capital requirement (SCR), 3 undertakings do not meet SCR, but cover MCR, 4 undertakings do not meet both MCR and SCR and the other 10 undertakings comply with Solvency II regulatory framework."The BSRE results revealed several deficiencies that must be corrected by the participating insurance undertakings, through the implementation of follow-up measures, aimed at restoring a solid position on solvency or remedying other deficiencies identified by the independent auditors", ASF said.The participating insurance undertakings must transmit ASF an action plan to remedy the issues identified by the BSRE test within 15 calendar days from the date of receipt of the decision relating to the communication of the BSRE results and supervisory measures. ASF shall consider all measures already implemented by the participating undertakings after the reference date of the BSRE test.ASF will review the action plans received within 5 calendar days from the date of their transmission, but not later than 11 December, and will make recommendations, where appropriate, to supplement and/or amend the same.If ASF considers that the action plans are not realistic or finds that the insurance undertakings did not make any significant progress in restoring the financial situation or the solvency, or fail to restore the financial situation or solvency at the end of the time-limits laid down, it will take, within four weeks, all measures necessary to safeguard the interests of insured persons.In the first part of this year, 13 insurance undertakings, which together hold over 80% of the domestic market, participated in a Balance Sheet Review - BSR & Stress Test - ST.
