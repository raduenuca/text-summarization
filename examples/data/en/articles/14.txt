The beginning was in 2002 with 3 employees. The initial premise of the shareholders was to increase the insurance coverage of the state enterprises that were underinsured. It was a challenge to give an example to the market, a thing that we have accomplished over the last 10 years.Starting from there, the target of the company were corporate clients, and subsequently, after 2 years, the balance began to shift to retail, which currently occupies an 80% of the company's business. Since the beginning the competition has been fierce and we had to make our place among the players. The solution was to find a niche for our development and I believe that our goal was met: after all, we were the first to report profit, a thing that we are still doing today.Also, we have always been against businesses or investments parallel to our operations, much of our assets are placed in bank deposits. After 10 years, the company's assets reached 696 mil Romanian lei, and insurance funds were up to RON 249 million. You can't pay claims if you don't have enough cash, and as a proof, only in the past 2 months we have paid over MDL 70 million, something that no other company in Moldova would be able to do in so short a time.There is a crisis of specialists in the insurance market and in the beginning we were in a tough situation, because we took on people from other companies. Afterwards, we realized the incompetency of many of them. Logically, we have decided to train them by selecting the best among them from the very beginning.I can proudly say that today we have a healthy team, which works for the company's idea, the honest fulfillment of our obligations towards the clients. We are involved in their improvement and they are the most important pillar of the company. They have to understand the concept of "where are we?" "who are we?" "what do we do, and where do we want to get?", a team which does not aim only at financial benefits. An essential point is to create a fair attitude among employees, honest and promising/providing quality to those affected and to customers in general. Another important aspect was the experience of European countries, and the experience obtained during our collaboration with ROSGOSSTRAKH.The company has retained over 50% of the employees who have worked in the company since its beginning In the last years few there are those who choose to leave elsewhere. What we are looking for is people who can make independent decisions and come up with solutions to problems, not just wait following the Soviet principle "the head will make the decision".Thus, we have created a team that takes into account our priorities, such as increased liquidity, a balanced portfolio of insurance policies and meeting our commitments on time. Currently, the company is operating with 800 employees (including agents), which manage over 30 insurance services and more than 100 different insurance programs.If I could go back in time, I would make exactly the same decisions; I consider I have worked correctly and honestly. The only thing that I would change though and which I would have given more attention to would be to have a larger influence on the market in general, especially over tariff levels, competition, attitude of insurance companies towards the customers etc. Unfortunately, in our society there still the perception that the poorer you are the better, but I believe that the market needs rich insurance companies that are capable to honor their obligations.Insurers are those that take people's money but do not pay - this is the consumers' perspective.Our advantage and disadvantage is the human factor. I'm referring to the employees as well as the company's clients. In MOLDOVA there is no insurance culture, insurers are thought to take money but never pay, while costumers most of the times do not read the conditions in the insurance contracts so they do not know the law and they are not particularly interested.Another issue is related to insurance regulations. The laws have been changing all the time but not always in the direction of creating a transparent market, being far from perfect. There is a need for adjustments that would allow the insurance market to evolve. Companies that are not able to maintain a fair level of financial stability and do not fulfilling their obligations towards customers discredit the market. Therefore, customers lose confidence in all companies on the market.We managed to occupy the leading position thanks to the use of new technologies and timely claim payments. However, this is the locomotive of the insurance market in Moldova. Also, we have a balanced and transparent policy towards our clients, whereby every time we show flexibility and help them in accordance with the law. We didn't invent anything new, but we worked according to our values and principles every day. We followed adventurous project that would jeopardize the company's activity and we worked as a true insurance company.As a result, despite the economic crisis, we managed to maintain a constant level of financial growth. Today we are holding a leading position on the market: over 115,000 vehicles insured annually and we insure over 80,000 tourists that travel abroad. Overall, we sign approximately 300,000 insurance contracts annually, of which 95% with individuals.Claims paid on time and in a wide amount this is the best advertisement for an insurer. The secondary means of informing the population is of course the media. Through our actions, we communicate with customers and we answer to them with the confidence we've shared with them. For example, during 2012, MOLDASIG paid ROM 100 million (USD 8.5 million) in damages to agriculture insurance, which is an unprecedented event for the local market. We do our work in a transparent and honest way and people's trust is we get back from them. It's a real factor that a true insurance company must consider important.The Russian Insurance Group became a shareholder of MOLDASIG in 2009, by acquiring a majority stake. I'm glad that it didn't depend on the opinion of the Russian group, since we were free to decide as we thought fit, given the specific market. When we were proposing a specific strategy of development and proposed/explained the arguments behind it, they were received. After the exit of the Russian company from MOLDASIG's shares (e.n.: midyear 2012), I believe that they were satisfied, we have kept good relations and all the necessary openness.Today the company's shareholders are eight businesses in Moldova, including three state companies. Naturally, they want profit and maximum profitability. Until now, we had strict requirements of profitability, but now we review internal and external costs, in order to achieve financial results that can be invested in the development of the company. For me, the end result is cash in accounts, which allows continued activity and not just figures on reports with no coverage.Generally speaking, the market is in need of radical changes as it is used to excessive freedom. There must be some clear rules of the game from the regulatory body, otherwise there will be someone to provide these services to consumers.For the time being we are analyzing the activity of ASITO Kapital (e.n: In late 2011, MOLDASIG took 99.9% of ASITO KAPITAL's shares in Romania) and its position on the insurance market in Romania, including the competition and as far as we know, it is quite tough. We acknowledge the fact that we have as competitors some of the largest European companies. Therefore, we will develop gradually, step by step, making thoughtful decisions and considering the situation. We will apply the strategy that guides us on the market in Moldova: to build with our clients relationships based on honesty and fulfill our obligations on time.I think it is imperative that supervisors should check constantly the solvency and the liquidity of companies on the market. Also, the legislation should be respected by all the insurance companies, leaving no room for insurers to interpret the law as they wish. Some insurers use small loopholes to create a pyramid insurance practice, which at some point will turn against customers and the reputation of all the companies on the market. In this regard, I would like greater control from CNPF aimed at market efficiency.We also have problems with MTPL claims or Green Card. If there is compulsory insurance we would like to have clear rules, be well informed on how and how much we are to pay, even if we have to pay more, in order for the clients to know the amount of compensation they will receive according to the law. Today, however, we have to take dozens of lawyers who participate in numerous cases, we have cases of fraud and so on. We should take a step at the time, start with respecting the law, have clear rules for paid claims, etc.Business return, interior regulation, recovery of collected amounts. We will raise the management and corporate governance quality of the company. Improving existing products will create preconditions for the strengthening of the insurance market.Development should be logical and correct, not just spontaneous. The objective of shareholders is to maintain the position held by the company on the market. In our strategy, we focus on an activity based on cost operational activity. Also, we strive for qualitative results, not quantitative ones. During the crisis, we seek new ways to optimize the processes within the company. We cannot tolerate the situation when the insurance sector is in a period of stagnation, so we turn to solutions for increasing profitability.In 10 years' time I still see the company on the first place, but the most important thing is to remain here in terms of quality. If what you do is right, then it's not worth quitting. I am involved in the insurance business and I wouldn't like to lose my place. My satisfaction is to see people are happy when they are compensated and I feel I have my personal contribution, in short, I do believe insurers have their role in the social system.
