There must be some clear rules of the game from the regulatory body , otherwise there will be someone to provide these services to consumers. For the time being we are analyzing the activity of ASITO Kapital ( e.n : In late 2011 , MOLDASIG took 99.9 % of ASITO KAPITAL 's shares in Romania ) and its position on the insurance market in Romania , including the competition and as far as we know , it is quite tough . What we are looking for is people who can make independent decisions and come up with solutions to problems , not just wait following the Soviet principle " the head will make the decision " .
